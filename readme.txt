A block pattern creation, management, and template library tool.

== Description ==

## Block Pattern Library
The Styles Library enhances the block pattern browsing experience. Browse core, theme, and your custom defined block patterns, and quickly use them. BlockStyles free block patterns are included. Easily import a block pattern into the editor in just a click.

The library is extendable with the premium BlockStyles membership. Get ready-to-use wireframe, section, and full-page block patterns which include images, typography, colors, backgrounds, etc. using the Block Styles plugin.

## Create Custom Block Patterns
Patterns are a "stamp" or group of blocks that are pre-styled in a way to get you going creating content faster. Create your own custom patterns to use anywhere on your site, as a time saving layout tool.

Think of a new design feel for your content? Create a new pattern, and "stamp" away!

== FAQ ==

= Can I add custom CSS? =
Not with Styles Library directly, however with our [Block Styles](https://blockstyles.com) plugin, you can! You can also check your theme's Customizer for added CSS support.

= Can I use premium third-party blocks for patterns? =
Yes! Use your favorite blocks to craete your patterns, no matter where they came from.

= What is the difference between a block pattern and a reusable block? =
A reusable block is a block that retains content, and block settings. When updating content or settings, all reusable blocks across your site will update.
Block Patterns are more of a "stamp", and can be customized every time you use one.

= What happens after I deactivate the plugin? =
Pattern Managment and the pattern explorer will no longer be available. Any patterns used in content will not be affected.
Your patterns won't be lost when deactivating or deleting the plugin. Although we always recommend backups and using exports

= Do I need a BlockStyles membership? =
No, Styles Library includes all patterns included in core, as well as BlockStyles free to use patterns.
