A block pattern creation, management, and template library tool.

== Description ==

## Block Pattern Library
The Styles Library enhances the block pattern browsing experience. Browse core, theme, and your custom defined block patterns, and quickly use them. BlockStyles free block patterns are included. Easily import a block pattern into the editor in just a click.

The library is extendable with the premium BlockStyles membership. Get ready-to-use wireframe, section, and full-page block patterns which include images, typography, colors, backgrounds, etc. using the Block Styles plugin.

## Create Custom Block Patterns
Patterns are a "stamp" or group of blocks that are pre-styled in a way to get you going creating content faster. Create your own custom patterns to use anywhere on your site, as a time saving layout tool.

Think of a new design feel for your content? Create a new pattern, and "stamp" away!

Want a consistent design and layout for your content features like a gallery, or table? Use block patterns and the Block Styles plugin to save fully designed block patterns, with all of your favorite blocks.

## Block Pattern Manager
Manage your custom created blocks easily from the admin. Edit or remove existing block patterns.
Create & manage block pattern categories and block pattern tags to easily find them in the library

Our mission is to provide WordPress users with an easy and convenient way to create their own block patterns and store them to use for later web pages.

* **Easily Manage Your Custom Block Patterns:** Block patterns are stored in the backend of your WordPress site and in the **Pattern Library**.

* **Categorize Block Patterns and Apply Tags:** Organize your block patterns by applying categories and tags.

* **Save Full Pages as Block Patterns:** Save time building webpages with the ability to save full WordPress pages as entire block patterns.

* **Import & Export Block Patterns:** Any block pattern you create can be downloaded via a JSON file and exported to be used on any other WordPress site you have.

* **Access Pre-Built Block Patterns:** Our team has built a handful of pre-built block patterns that are ready for you to download and use on your WordPress site.
